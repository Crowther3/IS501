                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why MBA?</h2>
                        <p>After 3 years of Project Management I recognized that my career growth plan was limited without having an engineering background.</p>
                        <p>I recognized in order to pivot out of Product Management and into a better career path a Full-time MBA was the best option available.  I spent months preparing for this life altering change and that's when I really learned about what I want to do with the rest of my life.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Learning about Product Management</h2>
                        <p>In preparing for the MBA I did a lot of info interviews to figure out what career paths were out there.  It was during this time that I learned about Product Management. I was able to ask many questions and get many resources to help understand what that career was.</p>
                        <p>I also used lots of resources from the <a href="https://www.producthive.org/" title="product hive"> Utah Product Hive Page</a></p>
                        <p>Here is a brief video explaining what Product Managers do.</p>

                        <p>I very quickly recognized my personal skills, as well as my historical experience and successes of working alongside engineers and knew that this was the path I needed to be on.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Resources and Experiences</h2>
                        <p>After deciding on Product Management I dove in headfirst to learn about anything and everything that I could.  I knew that I would be at a disadvantage to others with my lack of tech background and experiences and so I wanted to get going quickly.  Here is a breifly suummarize list of things I have done to help me get started in a career of Product Management</p>

                            <p>I am very excited and hopeful to create really innovative products that can actually bless and benefit people's every day lives.  I look forward to my first position in a company as a product manager and hope to utilize that as well as others in that company to continue to develop myself into the best product manager I can.  From there I will continue growing and look for products and experiences where I can see myself adding the most value as well as finding companies and products with a mission and product that I really believe in.</p>
